            <p>
              Harry Potter was prophesied to be the downfall of Lord Voldemort
              and therefore singled out at birth as the Dark Lord's rival. He
              was known in the wizarding world as 'The Boy Who Lived' after
              becoming the only known survivor of the Killing Curse, which was
              attempted by Voldemort when Harry was just a baby, after both his
              parents were murdered. But despite causing one of the most famous
              wizarding world events, Harry did not know he was a wizard until
              his eleventh birthday, due to his Muggle aunt and uncle neglecting
              to tell him. He would eventually go on to Hogwarts, discover his
              magical potential, and embark upon several great adventures with
              his best friends, Ron and Hermione.
